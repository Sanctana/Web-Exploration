        <h1 style="text-align: center; font-size: 3em;">Dreams in Motion</h1>
        <p style="text-indent: 2em; margin: -1em .5em 1em 1em;">At times, the weight of what we need to do feels overwhelming, but within that, there's 
            also space for the things we truly want. Dreams are the silent architects of our future—often 
            guiding us even when we aren't fully aware. This poem captures that quiet process of envisioning a life 
            that we haven't yet lived, but one we deeply hope for. It's a personal reflection on planning, dreaming, 
            and the balance between ambition and uncertainty.

            <h2 style="font-size: 2em;"><q>A Sketch of Dreams</q></h2>
            <p style="margin-top: -1em;">(<i>A self-made poem by Say</i>)</p>
        
            <br>
            <p>Today, I set aside what I must do,</p>
            <p>Drawn instead to something I love—</p>
            <p>Sketching within four corners,</p>
            <p>A house, a dream, a future home.</p>
             
            <br>
            <p>While sketching walls and floors,</p>
            <p>I envisioned more than just my doors.</p>
            <p>I imagined little feet running around,</p>
            <p>A husband's laughter, a love profound.</p>

            <br>
            <p>It made me laugh, imagining their faces,</p>
            <p>The laughter, the love, filling these spaces.</p>
            <p>It feels warm, a joy deep inside,</p>
            <p>A spark of hope I can't hide.</p>


            <br>
            <p>But then I wonder—will this plan come true?</p>
            <p>Will all my dreams in life break through?</p>
            <p>I don't know if i'll make it or not,</p>
            <p>But I'll give it all I've got.</p>

            <br>
            <p>Planning can feel heavy, sometimes unfair,</p>
            <p>Dreams and expectations tangled in the air.</p>
            <p>But isn't it beautiful to hope and strive,</p>
            <p>To envision the life you're meant to live and thrive?</p>

            <br>
            <p>Planning is reaching for something beyond,</p>
            <p>To live beyond routines and daily chores.</p>
            <p>If everyone dared to dream this way,</p>
            <p>The world would be filled with endless possibilities.</p>

            <br>
            <p>Someday, I'll hold this sketch in my hand,</p>
            <p>A house built by dreams and the work I planned.</p>
            <p>And softly, I'll whisper, <q>I made it through,</q></p>
            <p>A testament to the dreams that grew.</p>
