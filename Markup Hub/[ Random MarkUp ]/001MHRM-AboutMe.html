            <q>Every choice we make has the power to shape our story. Just one decision, big or small, 
                can alter the course of our lives. It's important to weigh the risks and exlpore the possibilities, 
                but always remember: sometimes, the most unexpected choices lead to the greatest beauty. And one day, 
                looking back, you'll realize that even the struggles were worth it.<i>You'll say, 'It wasn't so bad.'</i>

<h3>One Thing I Can Share from My First Semester Experience</h3>
    <p style="text-indent: 2.5rem;">I'm not sure if itâ€™s just the <i>right timing</i>, but I feel truly blessed to have had such a fun circle during 
        my first semester. As someone who doesn't love coding or programming, there were times when I reflected on my 
        experiences and <i>felt grateful</i> for the trustworthy and fun people around me.<br><br><span style="display: block; text-indent: 2.5rem;">Despite choosing a program that 
        I'm not passionate about, <b>having a good circle made it more enjoyable</b>. Although I didn't fully appreciate or 
        love programming last semester, I believe I will come to <b>love it eventually</b>, as I am surrounded by <b>positive and fun people</b>.<br><br><span style="display: block; text-indent: 2.5rem;">
        Now that I'm no longer with them in the second semester, I hope it will still be a fulfilling experience, and I trust that 
        time will help me overcome any challenges and succeed. <i>I can't afford to disappoint myself</i>, as I made this decision.</span>
    </p>

        <b>Life has a way of showing you that when you're struggling, if you take a moment to <i>look around</i>, the people around you 
        not only bring something meaningful into your life but also provide the support needed to help you through it.</b>
