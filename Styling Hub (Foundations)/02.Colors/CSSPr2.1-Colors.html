        <div class="hello" style="margin-bottom: -1rem; margin-top: 2rem;font-size: 2em; text-decoration: underline;"><p>Welcome to our Color Master Webpage!</p></div>
        <p style="text-align-last: center;">This site is designed to help you gain hands-on experience with various CSS color properties, 
          <i>including</i> <b>color, background-color, border-color, outline-color, and box-shadow</b>. By experimenting with these properties, you'll discover how colors can transform the look and feel of your webpages 
          and deepen your understanding of effective styling techniques.</p>

      <ol>
        <li><h3>Text Color Practice</h3></li>
        <p>Adjust the text color of headings, paragraph, and lists using different color codes. 
          Try colors like #1abc9c for a calming green, #f39c12 for a vabriant yellow, or #e74c3c for a striking red. 
          Notice how each color affects the emphasis and readability of the text.</p>
        <p>Experiment by applying these colors to different elements throughout the webpage. Observe the impact of colors on
          different backgrounds and text sizes.</p>
      
        <li><h3>Customize Background Colors</h3></li>
        <p>Apply background-color to various sections, boxes, or divs on your webpage. Try colors like #3498db for a cool blue, #9b59b6 for a soft purple, 
          or #34495e for a deep, dark gray. These colors help define sections and create contrast between elements.</p>
        <p>Experiment with layering different background colors to create emphasis or to set a visual hierarchy. Notice how background color influences the readability 
          and focus of your content.</p>
      
        <li><h3>Experiment with Borders</h3></li>
        <p>Use the border-color property to change the borders of elements like boxes, images, or buttons. Try using contrasting colors like #e67e22 for a bold orange, #2ecc71 
          for a fresh green, or #d35400 for a rich brown. Changing border colors can make elements stand out or blend in depending on your design intention.</p>
        <p>Play with different border styles (solid, dashed, dotted) in combination with these colors to see how it affects the visual presentation of you page.</p>
      
        <li><h3>Highlight with Outlines</h3></li>
        <p>Apply outline-color to elements to draw attention to specific parts of you webpage. Use colors like #1abc9c to add a soothing touch, #f1c40f for a bright pop, or #c0392b for 
          a bold accent. Experiment with the outline thickness and color to emphasize sections or specific elements.</p>
        <p>Adjusting outlines can create visual distinction between elements without changing their positioning or size. Play with different outline styles (solid, dashed) and colors to 
          understand their effect.</p>
      
        <li><h3>Add Depth with Shadows</h3></li>
        <p>Experiment with the box-shadow property to add depth and visual interest to your elements. Use different shadow colors like rgba(52, 152, 219, 0.5) for a soft blue shadow, rgba(231, 76, 60, 0.7) for a deep red, 
          or rgba(155, 89, 182, 0.5) for a dreamy purple. Adjust the blue, spread, and color to see how shadows influence the perception of elements on the page.</p>
        <p>Use shadows to create a sense of dimention and to make elements stand out. Try adding shadows to buttons, images, or text to see how they change the overall design feel.
